	<p>Using storytelling as a framework for my project can help connect the ideas I am attempting to lay out in a more straightforward manner because I am following a path through the story I am developing. I can split the work into the exposition, the conflict, the climax, and the resolution. This being the typical story format follows, can help me designate and assign each task under these parameters to better manage my time and decide where my focus for a particular task should be, based on my progress within the story.</p>

	<p> Good hierarchy can be created through incorporating the different versions of one or two fonts, through using bold, italics, small caps, and positioning that emphasizes the hierarchy. Using sans serif and serif within one work can help hierarchy as well.
