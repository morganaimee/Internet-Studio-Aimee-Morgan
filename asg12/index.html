	 <h1>Favorite Movies Gallery</h1>

<h2>I like all of the following movies because I love strong characters, friends to lovers, women as main characters, princesses, and most of all, adventure and the theme of love prevailing above all else. These movies are varied in their themes, but they please me all the same.</h2>
