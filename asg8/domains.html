	<h2>Partner Disccusion - Domain Names</h2>
	<p>The domain I needed to create should include the library within the name, so it is evident what the website is about from the jump. We also discussed how using the word free would get people’s attention, but it was a little muddled because I want a sub-page on my website where I have low-cost library cards mentioned as well.</p>

	<h3>Domain I like</h3>
	<p>The domain name I liked best was libraryaccess.org because it makes the goal of the website easily understandable, and it doesn’t emphasize anything other than the key point of the site, which is library access for people. I also like it because it sounds official, not cheap or like you would get scammed, which is important for people feeling safe about clicking on a link.</p>
