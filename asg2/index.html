	<h1>Part 2 Questions</h1>
	<p>What is the difference between structured content and semantic HTML? Structured content has very specific amounts of information in segments that are meant to work together with other information segments to create a functioning system of information for a website that will make sense as it is displayed on a website. Semantic HTML, on the other hand, is focused on detailing how elements in HTML work together, more so on the back end than on the final product of how a website is desired to look.
<br>
How do they work together? Together, you can create a great website that makes sense internally for the coder and functions well for the audience. You need both structured content for the website to make sense and semantic HTML to make sense of the code and ensure it can continue to serve the web page's needs.
<br>
Why is it important to have structured content and semantic HTML in your web pages? It is vital to have both structured content and semantic HTML in a web page to serve functionality for both users and coders, and to put out the best work possible.

<h3>Part 4 Questions</h3>
	
Denise Jacobs argues that we all have a troll-like inner critic. Of the methods she identifies to banish this troll, which would be most successful for you? Be deceptively non-committal. Why? Because it always works for me to say to myself, “Okay, I am just going to try this for ten minutes, and then I’ll give myself a break.” I find that once I start something, I want to keep going, and I get it done.

In David McRaney's article, what is "hyperbolic discounting"? It is when humans usually think more logically about something if they are forced to wait to act on it. Which is why acting on your immediate desire normally harms more than helps. List one method McRaney identifies to counteract hyperbolic discounting. Convince yourself that it is not current you, but later you that has to deal with the consequences, and act on that for what is best for future you. This works on me most of the time, acting in my future's best interest.

Critical Web Design addresses four types of power in networks. As you learn web publishing fundamentals, what network-making power do you (or don't you) have as the creator and publisher of your work? I have all the network-making power possible; basically, the limit is my creativity and understanding of the network I am crafting. Essentially, I am my biggest weakness and strength for my power, based on how I choose to utilize my web page skills.
