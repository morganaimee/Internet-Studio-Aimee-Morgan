 <p>Katniss Everdeen is a fictional character and the main protagonist of The Hunger Games trilogy written by American author Suzanne Collins. She is portrayed by Jennifer Lawrence in the film adaptations of the trilogy.</p>
  
 <p>Katniss and her family live in District 12, a coal-mining region that is the poorest, least populated, and smallest domain in Panemâ€”a dystopian autocratic nation in the ruins of North America, ruled over by the wealthy
class living in the Capitol.</p>
      
 <p>In the first book, The Hunger Games, Katniss competes as a "tribute" in a yearly fight to the death known as "The Hunger Games", volunteering to fight in place of her little sister, Primrose "Prim" Everdeen. Over the course of the trilogy, Katniss evolves from protector of her younger sister into a galvanizing symbol of rebellion against the Capitol's oppression. The rebellion against the Capitol is eventually victorious.</p>
