smallest domain in Panemâ€”a dystopian autocratic nation in the ruins of North America, ruled over by the wealthy
class living in the Capitol.

  In the first book, The Hunger Games, Katniss competes as a "tribute" in a yearly fight to the death known as 
  "The Hunger Games", volunteering to fight in place of her little sister, Primrose "Prim" Everdeen. 
  Over the course of the trilogy, Katniss evolves from protector of her younger sister into a galvanizing 
  symbol of rebellion against the Capitol's oppression. The rebellion against the Capitol
  is eventually victorious.
