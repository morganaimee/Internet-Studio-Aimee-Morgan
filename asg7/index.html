	<h1>Doechii's Run for Presidency</h1>
	<p>Doechii (Jaylah Hickmon) is a singer, rapper, and well-known icon. She has had many of her songs go viral on TikTok. She has been outspoken for many causes, advocating for people of color and queer people, among others. </p>
	<p>Deochii would make a good President of the U.S. because she is not a power-hungry person, and does not seem like the type that would try to be a world ruler. Because of this fact, I think this makes her a good candidate. She has strong morals, advocates for minorities, and is against the genocide in Gaza, all facts that make her a persuasive leader for the state of the world. She is only 27, which is compelling for a world leader, as we keep on having old people ruling the country, who cannot even speak coherent full sentences. She would be a refreshing change.</p>

	<h2>Doechii’s Vice President - SZA (Solána Rowe)</h2>
	<p>Sza would make a great Vice President because she is fun, light-hearted, yet she cares deeply about worldly issues, and as a Black woman, she understands how much the world is struggling right now because of world rulers. There needs to be younger, more woke leaders who understand the culture and how the world is shifting, and allow women, particularly women of color, a place in the world where they are truly welcome.</p>

<p>Doechii’s top campaign platform would be Instagram, where she currently has the most followers (5.9 million). Through Instagram, she could reach a great number of people, and through the algorithm, reach even more people. Her campaign could quickly be shared through people’s accounts, and there is a lot of room for growth and awareness.</p>
