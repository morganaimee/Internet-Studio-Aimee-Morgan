<h1>Advantages of sketching wireframes over using wireframe software</h1>

<p>The advantages of sketching wireframes over using wireframe software are speed, flexibility, and limited distractions.</p>

<h2>Disadvantages of sketching wireframes over using wireframe software</h2>

<p>The disadvantages are duplicate work, low-fidelity, non-interactive, no version control or standardization, limited collaboration, and finally, being ugly.</p>

<h3>What works best for me?</h3>

<p>Wireframing digitally would work best for me because I am really bad at sketching out my thoughts because I get stuck on how ugly it looks. I have never been confident in my drawing skills, and I think I will have more control and ultimately be happier with the outcome if it is digitally created.</p>

<h1>My name is Aimee Morgan, and this is the wireframes for my website called Free Library Access</h1>

<p>This is the homepage of my website. Please note that the website wireframes.cc would not download the png correctly and kept scrambling my design each and every time I tried to download it, so this is a screenshot I converted to png, hence the horrible image quality. Not sure why the website was being a hater</p>
