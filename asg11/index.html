	<h1>Dodgeball Team</h1>
	<p>My dodgeball team consists of Rengoku, Superman, Raven, Kuromi, and Faye. The name of the team is THE WINNERS, because all we do is win.</p>

		<h2>Rengoku</h2>
		<p>Rengoku is the perfect teammate for dodgeball because he is insanely strong and could smack down any opponent, no matter who!</p>
		<img class="image" src="images/super.png" width="200%" height="100%" >
		<h2>Superman</h2>
		<p>Superman is, well, a super man! He has extreme strength, anything beyond what the planet holds, so there is no loosing when he is on the team.</p>
		<img class="image" src="images/raven.png" width="100%" height="100%" >
		<h2>Raven</h2>
		<p>Raven is fierce and determined, with smart strategies that will guide the strength of the previously mentioned men, and make sure everyone keeps their cool and works together to take down any opponents we shall face.</p>
		<img class="image" src="images/kuromi.png" width="100%" height="100%" >
		<h2>Kuromi</h2>
		<p>She may look cute, but evil Kuromi holds much rage inside her little body, and with a refusual to give up, she holds the teams spirits high.</p>
		<img class="image" src="images/faye.png" width="100%" height="100%" >
		<h2>Faye</h2>
		<p>She has a glock, Faye is not here to play. While everyone is throwing and dodging balls, she is shooting her opponents balls. Everyone needs a girl like Faye on their team.</p>
