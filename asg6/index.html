	<h1>White Hat</h1>
	<p>I have information on some libraries that offer the kind of free online library cards, regardless of location, which is the key information I need. I need to have a longer list of libraries, or at least a complete list of what I can find soon. Need to do further research online. I could ask a librarian to share their perspective on the matter and see if they have any additional resources available.</p>

<h1>Red Hat</h1>

<p>Feel inspired, like this could be a helpful project that give greater access to reading and ultimately helps with the barrier of entry to reading materials and information that a library card can provide people. It can help the literary crisis by giving people more access to a larger variety of material to enjoy and learn from.</p>

<h2>Black Hat</h2>

<p>It could be too much work to keep the website updated and accurate to the ever-changing requirements of libraries, as the government is currently shifting away from encouraging education and there is a greater emphasis on shutting down local programs and banning books. Will people even think of such an idea to look it up and find my website?</p>

<h2>Yellow Hat</h2>

<p>Can greatly aid in the current literary crisis and information deserts, or those who have barriers to education and resources, such as a lack of transportation or a lack of a library in their area. It can help people access banned books and other such material that is in great demand by those wishing to propel their futures and learn more, and stimulate their minds outside of social media.</p>
	
<h3>Green Hat</h3>

<p>Social media could be used to help promote the website, which could help alleviate the worries about no one knowing about the website, and to use it as a resource. Reiterations of the yellow hat, basically, there is a great opportunity for growth and mental stimulation for those yearning for access to literature and the various other kinds of media one can access through an online library card. Also mentioned that it may provide libraries with greater funding if the government sees their resources being utilized. If a program is not used, it likely won’t be funded again in the same manner.  </p>
	
<h3>Blue Hat</h3>

<p>Partner liked that the webpage was already organized through the map we were tasked to create. Did not have much to add to this section; it seemed like the mapping process was enough of an organizational path to make sense for the final project’s outcome to be successful. 

</p>
	

<h3>How My Project has Changed</h3>

<p>Since talking with my partner outside of class, I have considered that talking to a librarian would be quite helpful in finding more sources. I have also alleviated some of my worries about the usefulness of the project, now that I am considering that I could be helping with funding by getting these resources to be used more. Overall, not a lot has fundamentally changed from my original plan, but I have more confidence in my project, and I am encouraged to work on it because of how it can help the communities I so desperately want to reach and provide resources to.</p>
