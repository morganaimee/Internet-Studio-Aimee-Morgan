   <h1>Aimee's Dream Jobs</h1>

   <p id="changecolor">My dream job is working in the legal field. Currently, I plan to acquire a paralegal certification after I graduate from undergrad. I want to work in Intellectual Property, Artificial Intelligence, Copyright law, Litigation, or Mergers & Acquisitions or some sector that joins these types of law together at a firm. My undergrad is in art, technology, and emerging communication, which directly applies knowledge to the options I want to work in, in the legal field. I am good with technology, I work currently in hospitality and customer service, I am good at managing many things at once, and I am above all, a people person who wants the best for my clients. I am honest, and would respect privacy and I work hard and long hours, so the legal field is up my alley. If I find myself thriving as a paralegal, I would like to attend law school and become an attorney.</p>

<p>Working in intellectual property as a legal assistant/paralegal is a great fit for me because I am able to work in a field I care greatly about. I would work on cases and prep documents for lawyers, work directly with clients and help schedule the lawyers day and meetings. I would be able to meet deadlines, write briefs and prepare several court documents, all the while working on subject matter I find interesting. With my paralegal certification, I should have an extensive knowledge of court procedures, legal filings, judicial processes, and the technology that is utilized within the systems to assist attorneys. </p>

As stated before, I would work on cases and prep documents for lawyers, work directly with clients and help schedule the lawyers day and meetings. I would be able to meet deadlines, write briefs and prepare several court documents, all the while working on subject matter I find interesting. With my paralegal certification, I will have an extensive knowledge of court procedures, legal filings, judicial processes, and the technology that is utilized within the systems to assist attorneys.</p>
