<h2>Interested in Accessing Other Libraries for a Low Cost?</h2>

<p id="special"><a href="https://www.usa.gov/libraries-and-archives">Find a Library Near You</a></p>

<p>Many libraries offer low cost library cards for non-residents. Check all the library branches in your state, as some offer library cards to non-residents who still live in the state for free.</p>

<p>If you want a larger catalog to work with, major city public libraries, such as New York City, Philadelphia, Houston, Los Angeles, and Boston provide the best variety to make the fee worth it. </p>

<p>Some states such as Texas's TexShare card, offer cards that allow patrons that are in good standing to access other libraries in the state and check out a limited amount of books at different branches.  </p>
