<h2>Our Misson Statement</h2>

<p>Here at Free Library Access, we believe in going the extra mile to help people find books they love, for free. The US is experiencing a literary crisis, as reading comprehension declines and reading levels continue to drop year after year in classrooms. We are doing our part to provide access to literature and a variety of other online resources, so if you struggle to find something to read easily, we hope to make it a bit easier. We will continue to do our best to update the list. If you see anything that is outdated, or want to suggest a new library to add to the list, please contact us!</p>
