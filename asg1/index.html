	<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
	<p>As the web is constantly changing, the goalpost for what developers can do and the tools available, the wax and wane article highlighted sticking to the basics first, to get down the fundamental framework of a website, and emphasized not being afraid of using hacks to get the desired outcome, but also to think about these implications for future use.

The evolution of the web article helped me understand the fast pace of change that the web underwent from completely static script pages to the dynamic and ever-shifting modular capabilities of modern webpages.

Chapter 0 of the textbook reiterated the concept from the wax and wane article, emphasizing caution for the newest and trendiest tools, as they may not be long-lasting and helpful, and essentially restated the importance of fundamental and traditional tools that are tried and true.

<h2>Semester One Project</h2>
	<p>For my semester one project, I would like to make a website page that helps Texas residents find library cards they can access online for greater access to free books. 
	This would be primarily compiling a list and linking library websites in an easy-to-access spot. This would help those who live in areas with a small or limited library system, and those
	who desire to read more kinds of books that their library catalog does not offer.</p>
