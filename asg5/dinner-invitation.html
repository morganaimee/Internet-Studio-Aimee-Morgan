	<h1>Chappell Roan</h1>

	<p>Chappell Roan is invited to this dinner, she is extremely 
	talented, a queer icon, and her conversation and perspective on Hollywood and moving from a small town to the big city would be insightful and make for a good time. She also is friends with people who went to UTD, which would be really cool to discuss.</p>

	<h1>SZA</h1>

	<p>SZA is also a talented artist that has toured the world and went through many phases throughout her time in the limelight. She also almost married someone she dated for over a decade, and could provide good conversation on dating and current day relationships. Her music is also just my favorite, so she has to be here.</p>

	<h1>Remi Wolf</h1>

	<p>Another iconic singer is Remi Wolf. She has battled addiction and struggled with her fame. Her life is more private than the other two singers, and her ideas on fame, Hollywood, and coping with the world of drugs and alcohol when being in recovery would be interesting to learn about.</p>
